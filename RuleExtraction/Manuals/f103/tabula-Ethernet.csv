In addition, full frames with a length less than the threshold are also transmitted. These bits are used only when the TSF bit (Bit 21) is cleared.
13 ST;Start/stoptransmission
;When this bit is set, transmission is placed in the Running state, and the DMA checks the transmit list at the current position for a frame to be transmitted. Descriptor acquisition is attempted either from the current position in the list, which is the transmit list base address set by the ETH_DMATDLAR register, or from the position retained when transmission was stopped previously. If the current descriptor is not owned by the DMA, transmission enters the Suspended state and the transmit buffer unavailable bit (ETH_DMASR [2]) is set. The Start Transmission command is effective only when transmission is stopped. If the command is issued before setting the DMA ETH_DMATDLAR register, the DMA behavior is unpredictable.
;When this bit is cleared, the transmission process is placed in the Stopped state after completing the transmission of the current frame. The next descriptor position in the transmit list is saved, and becomes the current position when transmission is restarted. The Stop Transmission command is effective only when the transmission of the current frame is complete or when the transmission is in the Suspended state.

7 FEF;Forward error frames
;When this bit is set, all frames except runt error frames are forwarded to the DMA.

However, if the frame’s start byte (write) pointer is already transferred to the read controller side (in Threshold mode), then the frames are not dropped. The Rx FIFO drops the error frames if that frame's start byte is not transferred (output) on the ARI bus.
6 FUGF;Forward under sized good frames
;When this bit is set, the Rx FIFO forwards undersized frames (frames with no error and length less than 64 bytes) including pad-bytes and CRC).
;When this bit is cleared, the Rx FIFO drops all frames of less than 64 bytes, unless such a frame has already been transferred due to lower value of receive threshold (e.g., RTC = 01).

2 OSF;Operate on second frame
;When this bit is set, this bit instructs the DMA to process a second frame of Transmit data even before status for first frame is obtained.
1 SR;Start/stopreceive
;When this bit is set, the receive process is placed in the Running state. The DMA attempts to acquire the descriptor from the receive list and processes incoming frames. Descriptor acquisition is attempted from the current position in the list, which is the address set by the DMA ETH_DMARDLAR register or the position retained when the receive process was previously stopped. If no descriptor is owned by the DMA, reception is suspended and the receive buffer unavailable bit (ETH_DMASR [7]) is set. The Start Receive command is effective only when reception has stopped. If the command was issued before setting the DMA ETH_DMARDLAR register, the DMA behavior is unpredictable.
;When this bit is cleared, RxDMA operation is stopped after the transfer of the current frame. The next descriptor position in the receive list is saved and becomes the current position when the receive process is restarted. The Stop Receive command is effective only when the Receive process is in either the Running (waiting for receive packet) or the Suspended state.

The MAC issues a Frame Abort status, along with the excessive deferral error bit set in the transmit frame status when the transmit state machine is deferred for more than 24 288 bit times in 10/100- Mbit/s mode. Deferral begins when the transmitter is ready to transmit, but is prevented because of an active CRS (carrier sense) signal on the MII. Defer time is not cumulative. If the transmitter defers for 10 000 bit times, then transmits, collides, backs off, and then has to defer again after completion of back-off, the deferral timer resets to 0 and restarts.

9 SAF;Source address filter
;The MAC core compares the SA field of the received frames with the values programmed in the enabled SA registers. If the comparison matches, then the SAMatch bit in the RxStatus word is set high. When this bit is set high and the SA filter fails, the MAC drops the frame. When this bit is reset, the MAC core forwards the received frame to the application. It also forwards the updated SA Match bit in RxStatus depending on the SA address comparison.
