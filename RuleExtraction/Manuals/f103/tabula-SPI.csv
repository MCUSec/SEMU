SPI_DR field descriptions;
15-0 DR[15-0];Dataregister
;Data received or to be transmitted.
;The data register is split into 2 buffers - one for writing (Transmit Buffer) and another one for reading (Receive buffer). A write to the data register will write into the Tx buffer and a read from the data register will return the value held in the Rx buffer.
;NOTE:These notes apply to SPI mode;
;Depending on the data frame format selection bit (DFF in SPI_CR1 register), the data sent or received is either 8-bit or 16-bit. This selection has to be made before enabling the SPI to ensure correct operation.
;For an 8-bit data frame, the buffers are 8-bit and only the LSB of the register (SPI_DR[7:0]) is used for transmission/reception. When in reception mode, the MSB of the register (SPI_DR[15;8]) is forced to 0.
;For a 16-bit data frame, the buffers are 16-bit and the entire register, SPI_DR[15:0] is used for transmission/reception.
