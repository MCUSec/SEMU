6-4 OC1M;Outputcompare1mode
;These bits define the behavior of the output reference signal OC1REF from which OC1 and OC1N are derived. OC1REF is active high whereas OC1 and OC1N active level depends on CC1P and CC1NP bits.
;000; Frozen - The comparison between the output compare register TIMx_CCR1 and the counter TIMx_CNT has no effect on the outputs.(this mode is used to generate a timing base).
;001; Set channel 1 to active level on match. OC1REF signal is forced high when the counter TIMx_CNT matches the capture/compare register 1 (TIMx_CCR1).

TIMx_RCR field descriptions;
7-0 REP;Repetition counter value
;These bits allow the user to set-up the update rate of the compare registers (i.e. periodic transfers from preload to active registers) when preload registers are enable, as well as the update interrupt generation rate, if this interrupt is enable.
;Each time the REP_CNT related downcounter reaches zero, an update event is generated and it restarts counting from REP value. As REP_CNT is reloaded with REP value only at the repetition update event U_RC, any write to the TIMx_RCR register is not taken in account until the next repetition update event.
;It means in PWM mode (REP+1) corresponds to:
;- the number of PWM periods in edge-aligned mode
;- the number of half PWM period in center-aligned mode.

;The active capture/compare register contains the value to be compared to the counter TIMx_CNT and signaled on OC1 output.
