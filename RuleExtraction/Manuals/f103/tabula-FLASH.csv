FLASH_SR field descriptions;
16 BSY;Busy
;This bit indicates that a Flash memory operation is in progress to/from one bank. It is set at the beginning of a Flash memory operation and cleared when the operation finishes or an error occurs.
8 RDERR;Proprietaryreadoutprotection(PCROP)error
;Set by hardware when a read access through the D-bus is performed to an address belonging to a proprietary readout protected Flash sector.
7 PGSERR;Programming sequence error
;Set by hardware when a write access to the Flash memory is performed by the code while the control register has not been correctly configured.
;Cleared by writing 1.
6 PGPERR;Programmingparallelismerror
;Set by hardware when the size of the access (byte, half-word, word, double word) during the program sequence does not correspond to the parallelism configuration PSIZE (x8, x16, x32, x64).
;Cleared by writing 1.
5 PGAERR;Programmingalignmenterror
;Set by hardware when the data to program cannot be contained in the same 128-bit Flash memory row. Cleared by writing 1.
4 WRPERR;Writeprotectionerror
;Set by hardware when an address to be erased/programmed belongs to a write-protected part of the Flash memory.
;Cleared by writing 1.
1 OPERR;Operationerror
;Set by hardware when a flash operation (programming/erase/read) request is detected and can not be run because of parallelism, alignment, write or read (PCROP) protection error. This bit is set only if error interrupts are enabled (ERRIE = 1).
0 EOP;
;this field is cleared by writing a 1.

FLASH_CR field descriptions;
31 LOCK;Lock
;Write to 1 only. When it is set, this bit indicates that the FLASH_CR register is locked. It is cleared by hardware after detecting the unlock sequence.
;In the event of an unsuccessful unlock operation, this bit remains set until the next reset.
25 ERRIE;Error interrupt enable
;This bit enables the interrupt generation when the OPERR bit in the FLASH_SR register is set to 1.
;0; Error interrupt generation disabled 
;1; Error interrupt generation enabled
24 EOPIE;End of operation interrupt enable
;This bit enables the interrupt generation when the EOP bit in the FLASH_SR register goes to 1.
;0; Interrupt generation disabled 
;1; Interrupt generation enabled
16 STRT;Start
;This bit triggers an erase operation when set. It is set only by software and cleared when the BSY bit is cleared.
