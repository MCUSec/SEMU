63 DIC;Disable interrupt on completion
;When set, this bit prevents setting the Status register’s RS bit (CSR5[6]) for the received frame ending in the buffer indicated by this descriptor. This, in turn, disables the assertion of the interrupt to Host due to RS for that frame.
62-61 Reserved;This field is reserved.
;This read-only field is reserved and always has the value 0.
60-48 RBS2;Receive buffer2 size
;These bits indicate the second data buffer size, in bytes. The buffer size must be a multiple of 4, 8, or 16, depending on the bus widths (32, 64 or 128, respectively), even if the value of RDES3 (buffer2 address pointer) is not aligned to bus width. If the buffer size is not an appropriate multiple of 4, 8 or 16, the resulting behavior is undefined. This field is not valid if RDES1[RCH] is set.
47 RER;Receive end of ring
;When set, this bit indicates that the descriptor list reached its final descriptor. The DMA returns to the base address of the list, creating a descriptor ring.
46 RCH;Second address chained

45 Reserved;This field is reserved.
;This read-only field is reserved and always has the value 0.
44-32;RBS1;Receive buffer 1 size
;Indicates the first data buffer size in bytes. The buffer size must be a multiple of 4, 8 or 16, depending upon the bus widths (32, 64 or 128), even if the value of RDES2 (buffer1 address pointer) is not aligned. When the buffer size is not a multiple of 4, 8 or 16, the resulting behavior is undefined. If this field is 0, the DMA ignores this buffer and uses Buffer 2 or next descriptor depending on the value of RCH (bit 14).

descriptors_TDES0 field descriptions;
31 OWN;Own bit
;When set, this bit indicates that the descriptor is owned by the DMA. When this bit is reset, it indicates that the descriptor is owned by the CPU. The DMA clears this bit either when it completes the frame transmission or when the buffers allocated in the descriptor are read completely. The ownership bit of the frame’s first descriptor must be set after all subsequent descriptors belonging to the same frame have been set.
30 IC;Interrupt on completion

;When set, this bit indicates that the buffer contains the first segment of a frame.
27 DC;Disable CRC

26 DP;Disable pad
;When set, the MAC does not automatically add padding to a frame shorter than 64 bytes.
;When this bit is reset, the DMA automatically adds padding and CRC to a frame shorter than 64 bytes, and the CRC field is added despite the state of the DC (TDES0[27]) bit. This is valid only when the first segment (TDES0[28]) is set.
25 TTSE;Transmit timestamp enable
;When TTSE is set and when TSE is set (ETH_PTPTSCR bit 0), IEEE1588 hardware time tamping is activated for the transmit frame described by the descriptor. This field is only valid when the First segment control bit (TDES0[28]) is set.
24 Reserved;This field is reserved.

;10; IP header checksum and payload checksum calculation and insertion are enabled, but pseudo-header checksum is not calculated in hardware
;11; IP Header checksum and payload checksum calculation and insertion are enabled, and pseudo-header checksum is calculated in hardware.
21 TER;Transmit end of ring
;When set, this bit indicates that the descriptor list reached its final descriptor. The DMA returns to the base address of the list, creating a descriptor ring.
20 TCH;Secondaddresschained
;When set, this bit indicates that the second address in the descriptor is the next descriptor address rather than the second buffer address. When TDES0[20] is set, TBS2 (TDES1[28:16]) is a “don’t care” value. TDES0[21] takes precedence over TDES0[20].

16 IHE;IP header error
;When set, this bit indicates that the MAC transmitter detected an error in the IP datagram header. The transmitter checks the header length in the IPv4 packet against the number of header bytes received from the application and indicates an error status if there is a mismatch. For IPv6 frames, a header error is reported if the main header length is not 40 bytes. Furthermore, the Ethernet length/type field value for an IPv4 or IPv6 frame must match the IP header version received with the packet. For IPv4 frames, an error status is also indicated if the Header Length field has a value less than 0x5.

14 JT;Jabber timeout
;When set, this bit indicates the MAC transmitter has experienced a jabber timeout. This bit is only set when the MAC configuration register’s JD bit is not set.
13 FF;Frame flushed
;When set, this bit indicates that the DMA/MTL flushed the frame due to a software Flush command given by the CPU.
12 IPE;IP payload error
;When set, this bit indicates that MAC transmitter detected an error in the TCP, UDP, or ICMP IP datagram payload. The transmitter checks the payload length received in the IPv4 or IPv6 header against the actual number of TCP, UDP or ICMP packet bytes received from the application and issues an error status in case of a mismatch.
11 LCA;Loss of carrier
;When set, this bit indicates that a loss of carrier occurred during frame transmission (that is, the MII_CRS signal was inactive for one or more transmit clock periods during frame transmission). This is valid only for the frames transmitted without collision when the MAC operates in Half-duplex mode.
10 NC;Nocarrier
;When set, this bit indicates that the Carrier Sense signal form the PHY was not asserted during transmission.
9 LCO;Late collision
;When set, this bit indicates that frame transmission was aborted due to a collision occurring after the collision window (64 byte times, including preamble, in MII mode). This bit is not valid if the Underflow Error bit is set.
8 EC;Excessive collision
;When set, this bit indicates that the transmission was aborted after 16 successive collisions while attempting to transmit the current frame. If the RD (Disable retry) bit in the MAC Configuration register is set, this bit is set after the first collision, and the transmission of the frame is aborted.
7 VF;VLAN frame
;When set, this bit indicates that the transmitted frame was a VLAN-type frame.
6-3 CC;Collision count
;This 4-bit counter value indicates the number of collisions occurring before the frame was transmitted. The count is not valid when the Excessive collisions bit (TDES0[8]) is set.
2 ED;Excessive deferral
;When set, this bit indicates that the transmission has ended because of excessive deferral of over 24 288 bit times if the Deferral check (DC) bit in the MAC Control register is set high.
1 UF;Underflow error
;When set, this bit indicates that the MAC aborted the frame because data arrived late from the RAM memory. Underflow error indicates that the DMA encountered an empty transmit buffer while transmitting the frame. The transmission process enters the Suspended state and sets both Transmit underflow (ETH_DMASR[5]) and Transmit interrupt (ETH_DMASR[0]).
0 DB;Deferred bit
;When set, this bit indicates that the MAC defers before transmission because of the presence of the carrier. This bit is valid only in Half-duplex mode.
