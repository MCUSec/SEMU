5 DMAERR;
;This bit is set if the USB Module has requested a DMA access to read a new BDT but has not been given the bus before it needs to receive or transmit data. If processing a TX transfer this would cause a transmit data underflow condition. If processing a RX transfer this would cause a receive data overflow condition. This interrupt is useful when developing device arbitration hardware for the microprocessor and the USB module to minimize bus request and bus grant latency.

The USB module contains a bus turnaround timer that keeps track of the amount of time elapsed between the token and data phases of a SETUP or OUT TOKEN or the data and handshake phases of a IN TOKEN. If more than 16 bit times are counted from the previous EOP before a transition from IDLE, a bus turnaround timeout error occurs.
3 DFN8;

;In Host mode, the frame adjustment is a twos complement number that adjusts the period of each USB frame in 12-MHz clock periods. A SOF is normally generated every 12,000 12-MHz clock cycles. The Frame Adjust Register can adjust this by -128 to +127 to compensate for inaccuracies in the USB 48-MHz clock. Changes to the ADJ bit take effect at the next start of the next frame.

USBx_CLK_RECOVER_CTRL field descriptions;
7 CLOCK_RECOVER_EN;Crystal-less USB enable
;This bit must be enabled if user wants to use the crystal-less USB mode for the Full Speed USB controller and transceiver.
;NOTE: This bit should not be set for USB host mode or OTG.
;0; Disable clock recovery block (default)
;1; Enable clock recovery block
6 RESET_RESUME_ROUGH_EN;Reset/resume to rough phase enable
;The clock recovery block tracks the IRC48Mhz to get an accurate 48Mhz clock. It has two phases after user enables clock_recover_en bit, rough phase and tracking phase. The step to fine tune the IRC 48Mhz by adjusting the trim fine value is different during these two phases. The step in rough phase is larger than that in tracking phase. Switch back to rough stage whenever USB bus reset or bus resume occurs.
;0; Always works in tracking phase after the 1st time rough to track transition (default)
;1; Go back to rough stage whenever bus reset or bus resume occurs
5 RESTART_IFRTRIM_EN;Restart from IFR trim value
;IRC48 has a default trim fine value whose default value is factory trimmed (the IFR trim value). Clock recover block tracks the accuracy of the clock 48Mhz and keeps updating the trim fine value accordingly
;0; Trim fine adjustment always works based on the previous updated trim fine value (default)
;1; Trim fine restarts from the IFR trim value whenever bus_reset/bus_resume is detected or module enable is desasserted

USBx_CLK_RECOVER_IRC_EN field descriptions;
7-2 Reserved;This field is reserved.
1 IRC_EN;IRC48M enable
;This bit is used to enable the on-chip IRC48Mhz module to generate clocks for crystal-less USB. It can be used for FS USB device mode operation. This bit must be set before using the crystal-less USB clock configuration.
;0; Disable the IRC48M module (default)
;1; Enable the IRC48M module
0 REG_EN;IRC48M regulator enable
;This bit is used to enable the local analog regulator for IRC48Mhz module. This bit must be set if user wants to use the crystal-less USB clock configuration.
;0; IRC48M local regulator is disabled
;1; IRC48M local regulator is enabled (default)

4 OVF_ERROR;
;Indicates that the USB clock recovery algorithm has detected that the frequency trim adjustment needed for the IRC48M output clock is outside the available TRIM_FINE adjustment range for the IRC48M module.
;0; No interrupt is reported
;1; Unmasked interrupt has been generated
