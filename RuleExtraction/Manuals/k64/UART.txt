Section 1
The UART has independent receive and transmit buffers. The size of these buffers may vary depending on the implementation of the module. The implemented size of the buffers is a fixed constant via PFIFO[TXFIFOSIZE] and PFIFO[RXFIFOSIZE]. Additionally, legacy support is provided that allows for the FIFO structure to operate as a depth of one. This is the default/reset behavior of the module and can be adjusted using the PFIFO[RXFE] and PFIFO[TXFE] bits. Individual watermark levels are also provided for transmit and receive.
There are multiple ways to ensure that a data block, which is a set of characters, has completed transmission. These methods include:
1. Set TWFIFO[TXWATER] to 0. TDRE asserts when there is no further data in the transmit buffer. Alternatively the S1[TC] flag can be used to indicate when the transmit shift register is also empty.
2. Poll TCFIFO[TXCOUNT]. Assuming that only data for a data block has been put into the data buffer, when TCFIFO[TXCOUNT] = 0, all data has been transmitted or is in the process of transmission.
3. S1[TC] can be monitored. When S1[TC] asserts, it indicates that all data has been transmitted and there is no data currently being transmitted in the shift register.

Section 2
This section outlines how to program the UART for ISO-7816 operation. Elements such as procedures to power up or power down the smartcard, and when to take those actions, are beyond the scope of this description. To set up the UART for ISO-7816 operation:
1. Select a baud rate. Write this value to the UART baud registers (BDH/L) to begin the baud rate generator. Remember that the baud rate generator is disabled when the baud rate is zero. Writing to the BDH has no effect without also writing to BDL. According to the 7816 specification the initial (default) baud rating setting should be Fi = 372 and Di = 1 and a maximum frequency of 5 MHz. In other words, the BDH,BDL, and C4 registers should be programmed such that the transmission frequency provided to the smartcard device must be 1/372th of the clock and must not exceed 5 MHz.
2. Write to set BDH[LBKDIE] = 0.
3. Write to C1 to configure word length, parity, and other configuration fields (LOOPS, RSRC) and set C1[M] = 1, C1[PE] = 1, and C1[PT] = 0.
4. Write to set S2[RWUID] = 0 and S2[LBKDE] = 0.
5. Write to set MODEM[RXRTSE] = 0, MODEM[TXRTSPOL] = 0, MODEM[TXRTSE] = 0, and MODEM[TXCTSE] = 0.
6. Write to set up interrupt enable fields desired (C3[ORIE], C3[NEIE], C3[PEIE], and C3[FEIE])
7. Write to set C4[MAEN1] = 0 and C4[MAEN2] = 0.
8. Write to C5 register and configure DMA control register fields as desired for application.
9. Write to set C7816[INIT] = 1,C7816[TTYPE] = 0, and C7816[ISO_7816E] = 1. Program C7816[ONACK] and C7816[ANACK] as desired.
10. Write to IE7816 to set interrupt enable parameters as desired.
11. Write to ET7816 and set as desired.
12. Write to set C2[ILIE] = 0, C2[RE] = 1, C2[TE] = 1, C2[RWU] = 0, and C2[SBK] = 0. Set up interrupt enables C2[TIE], C2[TCIE], and C2[RIE] as desired.
At this time, the UART will start listening for an initial character. After being identified, it will automatically adjust S2[MSBF], C3[TXINV], and S2[RXINV]. The software must then receive and process an answer to reset. Upon processing the answer to reset, the software must write to set C2[RE] = 0 and C2[TE] = 0. The software should then adjust 7816 specific and UART generic parameters to match and configure data that was received during the answer on reset period. After the new settings have been programmed, including the new baud rate and C7816[TTYPE], C2[RE] and C2[TE] can be reenabled as required.

Section 3
When the protocol selected is C7816[TTYPE] = 0, it is assumed that the software has a prior knowledge of who should be transmitting and receiving. Therefore, no mechanism is provided for automated transmission/receipt control. The software must monitor S1[TDRE], or configure for an interrupt, and provide additional data for transmission, as appropriate. Additionally, software should set C2[TE] = 1 and control TXDIR whenever it is the UART's turn to transmit information. For ease of monitoring, it is suggested that only data be transmitted until the next receiver/transmit switchover is loaded into the transmit FIFO/buffer.

Section 4
To initiate a UART transmission: 1. Configure the UART.
a.Select a baud rate. Write this value to the UART baud registers (BDH/L) to begin the baud rate generator. Remember that the baud rate generator is disabled when the baud rate is zero. Writing to the BDH has no effect without also writing to BDL.
b.Write to C1 to configure word length, parity, and other configuration bits (LOOPS, RSRC, M, WAKE, ILT, PE, and PT). Write to C4, MA1, and MA2 to configure.
c.Enable the transmitter, interrupts, receiver, and wakeup as required, by writing to C2 (TIE, TCIE, RIE, ILIE, TE, RE, RWU, and SBK), S2 (MSBF and BRK13), and C3 (ORIE, NEIE, PEIE, and FEIE). A preamble or idle character is then shifted out of the transmitter shift register.
2. Transmit procedure for each byte.
a. Monitor S1[TDRE] by reading S1 or responding to the TDRE interrupt. The amount of free space in the transmit buffer directly using TCFIFO[TXCOUNT] can also be monitored.
b. If the TDRE flag is set, or there is space in the transmit buffer, write the data to be transmitted to (C3[T8]/D). A new transmission will not result until data exists in the transmit buffer.
3. Repeat step 2 for each subsequent transmission.
Note: 
During normal operation, S1[TDRE] is set when the shift register is loaded with the next data to be transmitted from the transmit buffer and the number of datawords contained in the transmit buffer is less than or equal to the value in TWFIFO[TXWATER]. This occurs 9/16ths of a bit time after the start of the stop bit of the previous frame.
To separate messages with preambles with minimum idle line time, use this sequence between messages.
1. Write the last dataword of the first message to C3[T8]/D.
2. Wait for S1[TDRE] to go high with TWFIFO[TXWATER] = 0, indicating the transfer of the last frame to the transmit shift register.
3. Queue a preamble by clearing and then setting C2[TE].
4. Write the first and subsequent datawords of the second message to C3[T8]/D.
