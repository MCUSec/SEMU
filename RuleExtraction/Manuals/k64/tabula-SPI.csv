;0; Interrupt request.
;1; DMA request.

SPIx_PUSHR field descriptions;
31 CONT;Continuous Peripheral Chip Select Enable
;Selects a continuous selection format. The bit is used in SPI Master mode. The bit enables the selected PCS signals to remain asserted between transfers.
;0; Return PCSn signals to their inactive state between transfers.
;1; Keep PCSn signals asserted between transfers.
30-28 CTAS;Clock and Transfer Attributes Select
;Selects which CTAR to use in master mode to specify the transfer attributes for the associated SPI frame. In SPI Slave mode, CTAR0 is used. See the chip configuration details to determine how many CTARs this device has. You should not program a value in this field for a register that is not present.

27 EOQ;End Of Queue
;Host software uses this bit to signal to the module that the current SPI transfer is the last in a queue. At the end of the transfer, the EOQF bit in the SR is set.
;0; The SPI data is not the last data to transfer.
;1; The SPI data is the last data to transfer.
26 CTCNT;Clear Transfer Counter
;Clears the TCNT field in the TCR register. The TCNT field is cleared before the module starts transmitting the current SPI frame.
;0; Do not clear the TCR[TCNT] field.
;1; Clear the TCR[TCNT] field.

21-16 PCS;
;Select which PCS signals are to be asserted for the transfer. Refer to the chip configuration details for the number of PCS signals used in this MCU.
;0; Negate the PCS[x] signal.
;1; Assert the PCS[x] signal.
15-0 TXDATA;Transmit Data
;Holds SPI data to be transferred according to the associated SPI command.
