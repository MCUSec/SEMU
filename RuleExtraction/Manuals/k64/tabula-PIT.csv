PIT_MCR Field Description;
31-3 Reserved;This field is reserved.
;This read-only field is reserved and always has the value 0.
2 Reserved;This field is reserved.
1 MDIS;Module Disable - (PIT section)
;Disables the standard timers. This field must be enabled before any other setup is done.
;0; Clock for standard PIT timers is enabled.
;1; Clock for standard PIT timers is disabled.
0 FRZ;Freeze
;Allows the timers to be stopped when the device enters the Debug mode.
;0;Timers continue to run in Debug mode.
;1;Timers are stopped in Debug mode.

PIT_LDVALn Field Description;
31-0 TSV;Timer Start Value
;Sets the timer start value. The timer will count down until it reaches 0, then it will generate an interrupt and load this register value again. Writing a new value to this register will not restart the timer; instead the value will be loaded after the timer expires. To abort the current cycle and start a timer period with the new value, the timer must be disabled and enabled again.

PIT_CVALn Field Description;
31-0 TVL;Current Timer Value
;Represents the current timer value, if the timer is enabled. if CVALn[TVL] is zero, then PIT_TFLGn[TIF] is 1 and CVALn[TVL] is equal to LDVALn[TSV].
;NOTE: • If the timer is disabled, do not use this field as its value is unreliable.• The timer uses a downcounter. The timer values are frozen in Debug mode if MCR[FRZ] is set.

PIT_TCTRLn Field Description
31-3 Reserved;This field is reserved.
;This read-only field is reserved and always has the value 0.
2 CHN;Chain Mode
;When activated, Timer n-1 needs to expire before timer n can decrement by 1. Timer 0 cannot be chained.,
;0; Timer is not chained.,
;1; Timer is chained to previous timer. For example, for Channel 2, if this field is set, Timer 2 is chained to Timer 1.,
1 TIE;Timer Interrupt Enable
;When an interrupt is pending, or, TFLGn[TIF] is set, enabling the interrupt will immediately cause an interrupt event. To avoid this, the associated TFLGn[TIF] must be cleared first.
;0; Interrupt requests from Timer n are disabled.,
;1; Interrupt will be requested whenever TIF is set.,
0 TEN;Timer Enable
;Enables or disables the timer. 
;0; Timer n is disabled.
;1; Timer n is enabled.

PIT_TFLGn Field Description
31-1 Reserved;This field is reserved.
;This read-only field is reserved and always has the value 0.,
0 TIF;Timer Interrupt Flag SSpecific
;Sets to 1 at the end of the timer period.  Writing 0 has no effect. If enabled or, when TCTRLn[TIE] = 1, TIF causes an interrupt request.
;0; Timeout has not yet occurred.
;1; Timeout has occurred.
