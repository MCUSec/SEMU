30 BABR;Babbling Receive Error w1c
;Indicates a frame was received with length in excess of RCR[MAX_FL] bytes.
29 BABT;Babbling Transmit Error w1c
;Indicates the transmitted frame length exceeds RCR[MAX_FL] bytes. Usually this condition is caused when a frame that is too long is placed into the transmit data buffer(s). Truncation does not occur.
28 GRA;Graceful Stop Complete w1c
;This interrupt is asserted after the transmitter is put into a pause state after completion of the frame currently being transmitted. See Graceful Transmit Stop (GTS) for conditions that lead to graceful stop.
;NOTE: The GRA interrupt is asserted only when the TX transitions into the stopped state. If this bit is cleared by writing 1 and the TX is still stopped, the bit is not set again.
27 TXF;Transmit Frame Interrupt w1c
;Indicates a frame has been transmitted and the last corresponding buffer descriptor has been updated.
26 TXB;Transmit Buffer Interrupt w1c

21 LC; Late Collision w1c
;Indicates a collision occurred beyond the collision window (slot time) in half-duplex mode. The frame truncates with a bad CRC and the remainder of the frame is discarded.
20 RL;Collision Retry Limit w1c
;Indicates a collision occurred on each of 16 successive attempts to transmit the frame. The frame is discarded without being transmitted and transmission of the next frame commences. This error can only occur in half-duplex mode.
19 UN;Transmit FIFO Underrun w1c
;Indicates the transmit FIFO became empty before the complete frame was transmitted. A bad CRC is appended to the frame fragment and the remainder of the frame is discarded.
18 PLR;Payload Receive Error w1c
;Indicates a frame was received with a payload length error. See Frame Length/Type Verification: Payload Length Check for more information.
17 WAKEUP;Node Wakeup Request Indication w1c

6-5 Reserved;This field is reserved.
;This read-only field is reserved and always has the value 0.
4 PEREN;Enable Periodical Event 
;0; Disable.
;1;A period event interrupt can be generated (EIR[TS_TIMER]) and the event signal output is asserted when the timer wraps around according to the periodic setting ATPER. The timer period value must be set before setting this bit.
;NOTE: Not all devices contain the event signal output. See the chip configuration details.
3 OFFRST;Reset Timer On Offset Event
;0; The timer is not affected and no action occurs, besides clearing OFFEN, when the offset is reached.
;1; If OFFEN is set, the timer resets to zero when the offset setting is reached. The offset event does not cause a timer interrupt.
2 OFFEN;Enable One-Shot Offset Event
;0; Disable.
;1; The timer can be reset to zero when the given offset time is reached (offset event). The field is cleared when the offset event is reached, so no further event occurs until the field is set again. The timer offset value must be set before setting this field.
1 Reserved;This field is reserved.

ENET_ATVR field descriptions;
31-0 ATIME;
;A write sets the timer. A read returns the last captured value. To read the current value, issue a capture command (set ATCR[CAPTURE]) prior to reading this register.

ENET_ATOFF field descriptions;
31-0 OFFSET;Offset value for one-shot event generation. When the timer reaches the value, an event can be generated to reset the counter. If the increment value in ATINC is given in true nanoseconds, this value is also given in true nanoseconds.

ENET_ATPER field descriptions;
31-0 PERIOD;
;Value for generating periodic events. Each instance the timer reaches this value, the period event occurs and the timer restarts. If the increment value in ATINC is given in true nanoseconds, this value is also given in true nanoseconds. The value should be initialized to 1,000,000,000 (1 x 10 9 ) to represent a timer wrap around of one second. The increment value set in ATINC should be set to the true nanoseconds of the period of clock ts_clk, hence implementing a true 1 second counter.

ENET_ATCOR field descriptions;
31 Reserved;This field is reserved.
;This read-only field is reserved and always has the value 0.
30-0 COR;Correction Counter Wrap-Around Value
;Defines after how many timer clock cycles (ts_clk) the correction counter should be reset and trigger a correction increment on the timer. The amount of correction is defined in ATINC[INC_CORR]. A value of 0 disables the correction counter and no corrections occur.
;NOTE: This value is given in clock cycles, not in nanoseconds as all other values.

ENET_ATINC field descriptions;
31-15 Reserved;This field is reserved.
;This read-only field is reserved and always has the value 0.
14-8 INC_CORR;Correction Increment Value
;This value is added every time the correction timer expires (every clock cycle given in ATCOR). A value less than INC slows down the timer. A value greater than INC speeds up the timer.
7 Reserved;This field is reserved.
;This read-only field is reserved and always has the value 0.
6-0 INC;Clock Period Of The Timestamping Clock (ts_clk) In Nanoseconds
;The timer increments by this amount each clock cycle. For example, set to 10 for 100 MHz, 8 for 125 MHz, 5 for 200 MHz.
;NOTE: For highest precision, use a value that is an integer fraction of the period set in ATPER.

7 TF;Timer Flag
;Sets when input capture or output compare occurs. This flag is double buffered between the module clock and 1588 clock domains. When this field is 1, it can be cleared to 0 by writing 1 to it.
;0; Input Capture or Output Compare has not occurred
;1; Input Capture or Output Compare has occurred
6 TIE;Timer Interrupt Enable
;0; Interrupt is disabled
;1; Interrupt is enabled
5-2 TMODE;Timer Mode
;Updating the Timer Mode field takes a few cycles to register because it is synchronized to the 1588 clock. The version of Timer Mode returned on a read is from the 1588 clock domain. When changing Timer Mode, always disable the channel and read this register to verify the channel is disabled first.

ENET_TCCRn field descriptions;
31-0 TCC;Timer Capture Compare
;This register is double buffered between the module clock and 1588 clock domains.
;When configured for compare, the 1588 clock domain updates with the value in the module clock domain whenever the Timer Channel is first enabled and on each subsequent compare. Write to this register with the first compare value before enabling the Timer Channel. When the Timer Channel is enabled, write the second compare value either immediately, or at least before the first compare occurs. After each compare, write the next compare value before the previous compare occurs and before clearing the Timer Flag.
;The compare occurs one 1588 clock cycle after the IEEE 1588 Counter increments past the compare value in the 1588 clock domain. If the compare value is less than the value of the 1588 Counter when the Timer Channel is first enabled, then the compare does not occur until following the next overflow of the 1588 Counter. If the compare value is greater than the IEEE 1588 Counter when the 1588 Counter overflows, or the compare value is less than the value of the IEEE 1588 Counter after the overflow, then the compare occurs one 1588 clock cycle following the overflow.
;When configured for Capture, the value of the IEEE 1588 Counter is captured into the 1588 clock domain and then updated into the module clock domain, provided the Timer Flag is clear. Always read the capture value before clearing the Timer Flag.
