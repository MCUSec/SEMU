MCG_S Field Description;
7 LOLS0;Loss of Lock Status
;This bit is a sticky bit indicating the lock status for the PLL. LOLS is set if after acquiring lock, the PLL output frequency has fallen outside the lock exit frequency tolerance, D unl . LOLIE determines whether an interrupt request is made when LOLS is set. LOLRE determines whether a reset request is made when LOLS is set. This bit is cleared by reset or by writing a logic 1 to it when set. Writing a logic 0 to this bit has no effect.
;0;PLL has not lost lock since LOLS 0 was last cleared.
;1;PLL has lost lock since LOLS 0 was last cleared.
6 LOCK0;Lock Status
;This bit indicates whether the PLLS has acquired lock. LOCK0 is enabled when the PLL is enabled (either through clock mode selection or PLLCLKEN0 = 1 setting). While the PLL clock is locking to the desired frequency, the MCG PLL clock (MCGPLLCLK) will be gated off until the LOCK bit gets asserted. If the lock status bit is set, changing the value of the PRDIV0 [4:0] bits in the C5 register or the VDIV0[4:0] bits in the C6 register causes the lock status bit to clear and stay cleared until the PLL has reacquired lock. Loss of PLL reference clock will also cause the LOCK0 bit to clear until the PLL has reacquired lock. Entry into LLS, VLPS, or regular Stop with PLLSTEN=0 also causes the lock status bit to clear and stay cleared until the Stop mode is exited and the PLL has reacquired lock. Any time the PLL is enabled and the LOCK0 bit is cleared, the MCGPLLCLK will be gated off until the LOCK0 bit is asserted again.

;;1 is written to C2[LP].
;In BLPI mode, MCGOUTCLK is derived from the internal reference clock. The FLL is disabled and PLL is disabled even if C5[PLLCLKEN] is set to 1.
Bypassed Low Power External (BLPE);Bypassed Low Power External (BLPE) mode is entered when all the following conditions occur:
;; 10 is written to C1[CLKS].
;; 0 is written to C1[IREFS].
;;1 is written to C2[LP].
;In BLPE mode, MCGOUTCLK is derived from the OSCSEL external reference clock. The FLL is disabled and PLL is disabled even if the C5[PLLCLKEN] is set to 1.
Stop;Entered whenever the MCU enters a Stop state. The power modes are chip specific. For power mode assignments, see the chapter that describes how modules are configured and MCG behavior during Stop recovery. Entering Stop mode, the FLL is disabled, and all MCG clock signals are static except in the following case:
;MCGPLLCLK is active in Normal Stop mode when PLLSTEN=1
;MCGIRCLK is active in Normal Stop mode when all the following conditions become true:
;• C1[IRCLKEN] = 1
;• C1[IREFSTEN] = 1
;NOTE: 
;• In VLPS Stop Mode, the MCGIRCLK can be programmed to stay enabled and continue running if C1[IRCLKEN] = 1, C1[IREFSTEN]=1, and Fast IRC clock is selected (C2[IRCS] = 1)
;• When entering Low Power Stop modes (LLS or VLPS) from PEE mode, on exit the MCG clock mode is forced to PBE clock mode. C1[CLKS] and S[CLKST] will be configured to 2’b10if entering from PEE mode or to 2’b01 if entering from PEI mode, C5[PLLSTEN0] will be force to 1'b0 and S[LOCK] bit will be cleared without setting S[LOLS].
;• When entering Normal Stop mode from PEE mode and if C5[PLLSTEN]=0, on exit the MCG clock mode is forced to PBE mode, the C1[CLKS] and S[CLKST] will be configured to 2’b10 and S[LOCK] bit will clear without setting S[LOLS]. If C5[PLLSTEN]=1, the S[LOCK] bit will not get cleared and on exit the MCG will continue to run in PEE mode.
