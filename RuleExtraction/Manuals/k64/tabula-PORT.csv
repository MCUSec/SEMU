PORTx_DFCR field descriptions;
0 CS;Clock Source
;The digital filter configuration is valid in all digital pin muxing modes. Configures the clock source for the digital input filters. Changing the filter clock source must be done only when all digital filters are disabled.

PORTx_DFWR field descriptions;
4-0 FILT;Filter Length
;The digital filter configuration is valid in all digital pin muxing modes. Configures the maximum size of the glitches, in clock cycles, that the digital filter absorbs for the enabled digital filters. Glitches that are longer than this register setting will pass through the digital filter, and glitches that are equal to or less than this register setting are filtered. Changing the filter length must be done only after all filters are disabled.
