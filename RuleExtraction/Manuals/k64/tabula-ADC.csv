7 COCO;end of conversion READ ONLY
;This is a read-only field that is set each time a conversion is completed when the compare function is disabled, or SC2[ACFE]=0 and the hardware average function is disabled, or SC3[AVGE]=0. When the compare function is enabled, or SC2[ACFE]=1, COCO is set upon completion of a conversion only if the compare result is true. When the hardware average function is enabled, or SC3[AVGE]=1, COCO is set upon completion of the selected number of conversions (determined by AVGS). COCO in SC1A is also set at the completion of a calibration sequence. COCO is cleared when the respective SC1n register is written or when the respective Rn register is read.
;0; Conversion is not completed.
;1; Conversion is completed.
6 AIEN;Interrupt Enable
;Enables conversion complete interrupts. When COCO becomes set while the respective AIEN is high, an interrupt is asserted. when DMAEN and COCO is set, it request DMA.
;0; Conversion complete interrupt is disabled.
;1; Conversion complete interrupt is enabled.
5 DIFF;Differential Mode Enable
;Configures the ADC to operate in differential mode. When enabled, this mode automatically selects from the differential channels, and changes the conversion algorithm and the number of cycles to complete a conversion.
;0; Single-ended conversions and input channels are selected.
;1; Differential conversions and input channels are selected.
4-0 ADCH;Input channel select
;Selects one of the input channels. The input channel decode depends on the value of DIFF. DAD0-DAD3 are associated with the input pin pairs DADPx and DADMx.
;NOTE: Some of the input channel options in the bitfield-setting descriptions might not be available for your device. For the actual ADC channel assignments for your device, see the Chip Configuration details.
;The successive approximation converter subsystem is turned off when the channel select bits are all set, that is, ADCH = 11111. This feature allows explicit disabling of the ADC and isolation of the input channel from all sources. Terminating continuous conversions this way prevents an additional single conversion from being performed. It is not necessary to set ADCH to all 1s to place the ADC in a low-power state when continuous conversions are not enabled because the module automatically enters a low-power state when a conversion completes.

4 ADLSMP;Sample Time Configuration
;Selects between different sample times based on the conversion mode selected. This field adjusts the sample period to allow higher impedance inputs to be accurately sampled or to maximize conversion speed for lower impedance inputs. Longer sample times can also be used to lower overall power consumption if continuous conversions are enabled and high conversion rates are not required. When ADLSMP=1, the long sample time select bits, (ADLSTS[1:0]), can select the extent of the long sample time.
;0; Short sample time.
;1; Long sample time.
3-2 MODE;Conversion mode selection

;00; When DIFF=0:It is single-ended 8-bit conversion. when DIFF=1, it is differential 9-bit conversion with 2's complement output.
;01; When DIFF=0:It is single-ended 12-bit conversion. when DIFF=1, it is differential 13-bit conversion with 2's complement output.
;10; When DIFF=0:It is single-ended 10-bit conversion. when DIFF=1, it is differential 11-bit conversion with 2's complement output
;11; When DIFF=0:It is single-ended 16-bit conversion. when DIFF=1, it is differential 16-bit conversion with 2's complement output
1-0 ADICLK;Input Clock Select
;Selects the input clock source to generate the internal clock, ADCK. Note that when the ADACK clock source is selected, it is not required to be active prior to conversion start. When it is selected and it is not active prior to a conversion start, when CFG2[ADACKEN]=0, the asynchronous clock is activated at the start of a conversion and deactivated when conversions are terminated. In this case, there is an associated clock startup delay each time the clock source is re-activated.

3 ADACKEN;Asynchronous Clock Output Enable
;Enables the asynchronous clock source and the clock source output regardless of the conversion and status of CFG1[ADICLK]. Based on MCU configuration, the asynchronous clock may be used by other modules. See chip configuration information. Setting this field allows the clock to be used even while the ADC is idle or operating from a different clock source. Also, latency of initiating a single or first-continuous conversion with the asynchronous clock selected is reduced because the ADACK clock is already operational.
;0; Asynchronous clock output disabled. Asynchronous clock is enabled only if selected by ADICLK and a conversion is active.
;1; Asynchronous clock and clock output is enabled regardless of the state of the ADC.
