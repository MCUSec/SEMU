RTC_TSR field descriptions;
31-0 TSR;Time Seconds Register
;When the time counter is enabled, the TSR is read only and increments once a second provided SR[TOF] or SR[TIF] are not set. The time counter will read as zero when SR[TOF] or SR[TIF] are set. When the time counter is disabled, the TSR can be read or written. Writing to the TSR when the time counter is disabled will clear the SR[TOF] and/or the SR[TIF]. Writing to TSR with zero is supported, but not recommended because TSR will read as zero when SR[TIF] or SR[TOF] are set (indicating the time is invalid).

RTC_TPR field descriptions;
15-0 TPR;Time Prescaler Register
;When the time counter is enabled, the TPR is read only and increments every 32.768 kHz clock cycle. The time counter will read as zero when SR[TOF] or SR[TIF] are set. When the time counter is disabled, the TPR can be read or written. The TSR[TSR] increments when bit 14 of the TPR transitions from a logic one to a logic zero.

RTC_TAR field descriptions;
31-0 TAR;Time Alarm Register
;When the time counter is enabled, the SR[TAF] is set whenever the TAR[TAR] equals the TSR[TSR] and the TSR[TSR] increments. Writing to the TAR clears the SR[TAF].

RTC_TCR field descriptions;
31-24 CIC;Compensation Interval Counter
;Current value of the compensation interval counter. If the compensation interval counter equals zero then it is loaded with the contents of the CIR. If the CIC does not equal zero then it is decremented once a second.
23-16 TCV;Time Compensation Value
;Current value used by the compensation logic for the present second interval. Updated once a second if the CIC equals 0 with the contents of the TCR field. If the CIC does not equal zero then it is loaded with zero (compensation is not enabled for that second increment).
15-8 CIR;Compensation Interval Register
;Configures the compensation interval in seconds from 1 to 256 to control how frequently the TCR should adjust the number of 32.768 kHz cycles in each second. The value written should be one less than the number of seconds. For example, write zero to configure for a compensation interval of one second. This register is double buffered and writes do not take affect until the end of the current compensation interval.

;Configures the number of 32.768 kHz clock cycles in each second. This register is double buffered and writes do not take affect until the end of the current compensation interval.
